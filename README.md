### About

If you'd like to learn more about our mission at Bruin Subleasing and some of our key values, check out our About page!

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The project is configured to automatically listen to refreshed and update as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages, meaning a files name is how it will be accessed in your url.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Framework
